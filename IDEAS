Injuries
========

The amount of damage caused is inversely proportional to the amount of agonised rolling about on the floor the player does.

You can see how bad the foul was, partly by the volume and type of noise produced,and partly by the amount of blood that 
splatters about the place.

Deaths on the pitch can occur, as can irrevocable damage e.g. breaking the back, etc. However, these are rare cases and
would only happen if the player was negligent - i.e., leaving an already injured player on the pitch.

It is possible to foul the referee. This probably leads to suspension, or lifetime ban from football (?)

Players limp when injured. When seriously injured, they will fall over every so often on the floor in agony (?),
or you will see them bleeding on the pitch.

Fouls only occur if the referee or linesmen see it.

Referees
========

Different referees have different tendencies - how strict they are being the main one


Commentators
============

There will be a number of commentators. Each has his (or her) own personality, and "clued up" level about the game. Conversations
are based on a set of, say, fifty commentaries, insults and random comments. Each match, two commentators will be put in the
box together (perhaps being able to place bets on who 'wins'?) and commentate on the match as well as keeping you interested.

Some example dialogs :

1: "There's some people on the pitch - they think it's all over! Oh, no wait a minute, it's a streaker."
2: "Well, that's not the sort of thing you see everyday in todays football is it."
1: "You don't know where to go"


1: "I take offense at being called a gibbering simpleton!"
2: "Would it help if I was to laugh at you at this point?"

1: "He passes, ball picked up, passes again, passes again, passes again, passes again, passes again"
2: "*YAWN*"
1: "passes again, get's tackled, passes againg"
2: "*SNORE*"
1: "He shoots, goalie saves!"
2: "*SNOR- GRUNT, huh, what?"


Players
=======

Each player has a personal picture, personal stats, etc.


Things to happen when the game is paused
----------------------------------------

Sing songs.

"Why are we waiting. Whh-h-hy are we waiting?"

Start with a single player, build up to a 11 (23?) part harmony
"Where's the user, where's the user - where's the user of the game? (of the game) Where's the user of the game?"

Player puts hands to his mouth and shouts at screen
"What, are you having a CRAP or something???"

Once everything else has been played, we get the following.

One of the players collapses, the others huddle round.
"I... I don't think I can take any more, I'm... I'm dying here... Please. If you have to... do what you must to survive. UUURrrrghhhh!"
Another player:
"Now he mentions it, I am feeling kinda peckish."
A tent (or censored sign) appears over the players, the sound of munching, and the odd bone being discarded to the side.
If the player comes back, on the team screens, he will notice that the players injury status will have become "eaten", which,
in effect means that they are dead.
